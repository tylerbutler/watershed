    " Lustre is a library for rendering Web applications and components using\n"
    " Gleam. This module contains the core API for constructing and communicating\n"
    " with Lustre applications. If you're new to Lustre or frontend development in\n"
    " general, make sure you check out the [examples](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples)\n"
    " or the [quickstart guide](./guide/01-quickstart.html) to get up to speed!\n"
    "\n"
    " Lustre currently has three kinds of application:\n"
    "\n"
    " 1. A client-side single-page application: think Elm or React or Vue. These\n"
    "    are applications that run in the client's browser and are responsible for\n"
    "    rendering the entire page.\n"
    "\n"
    " 2. A client-side component: an encapsulated Lustre application that can be\n"
    "    rendered inside another Lustre application as a Web Component. Communication\n"
    "    happens via attributes and event listeners, like any other HTML element.\n"
    "\n"
    " 3. A server component. These are applications that run anywhere Gleam runs\n"
    "    and communicate with any number of connected clients by sending them\n"
    "    patches to apply to their DOM.\n"
    "\n"
    "    There are two pieces to a server component: the main server component\n"
    "    runtime that contains your application logic, and a client-side runtime\n"
    "    that listens for patches over a WebSocket and applies them to the DOM.\n"
    "\n"
    "    The server component runtime can run anywhere Gleam does, but the\n"
    "    client-side runtime must be run in a browser. To use it, either render the\n"
    "    [provided script element](./lustre/server_component.html#script) or serve\n"
    "    the pre-bundled scripts found in Lustre's `priv/` directory directly.\n"
    "\n"
    " No matter where a Lustre application runs, it will always follow the same\n"
    " Model-View-Update architecture. Popularised by Elm (where it is known as The\n"
    " Elm Architecture), this pattern has since made its way into many other\n"
    " languages and frameworks and has proven to be a robust and reliable way to\n"
    " build complex user interfaces.\n"
    "\n"
    " There are three main building blocks to the Model-View-Update architecture:\n"
    "\n"
    " - A `Model` that represents your application's state and an `init` function\n"
    "   to create it.\n"
    "\n"
    " - A `Message` type that represents all the different ways the outside world can\n"
    "   communicate with your application and an `update` function that modifies\n"
    "   your model in response to those messages.\n"
    "\n"
    " - A `view` function that renders your model to HTML, represented as an\n"
    "   `Element`.\n"
    "\n"
    " To see how those pieces fit together, here's a little diagram:\n"
    "\n"

    " different kinds of applications. If you're just getting started with Lustre\n"
    " or frontend development, we recommend reading through them in order:\n"
    "\n"
    " - [`01-quickstart`](./guide/01-quickstart.html)\n"
    " - [`02-state-management`](./guide/02-state-management.html)\n"
    " - [`03-side-effects`](./guide/03-side-effects.html)\n"
    " - [`04-spa-deployments`](./guide/04-spa-deployments.html)\n"
    " - [`05-server-side-rendering`](./guide/05-server-side-rendering.html)\n"
    " - [`06-full-stack-applications`](./guide/06-full-stack-applications.html)\n"
    " - [`07-full-stack-deployments`](./guide/07-full-stack-deployments.html)\n"

    " - [`09-server-components`](./guide/09-server-components.html)\n"
    "\n"
    " This list of guides is likely to grow over time, so be sure to check back\n"
    " every now and then to see what's new!\n"
    "\n"
    " ## Examples\n"
    "\n"
    " If you prefer to learn by seeing and adapting existing code, there are also\n"
    " a number of examples in the [Lustre GitHub repository](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre)\n"
    " that each demonstrate a different concept or idea. While we can't list them\n"
    " all here, some of the more important ones are:\n"
    "\n"
    " - [`Controlled inputs`](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/02-inputs/01-controlled-inputs)\n"
    " - [`Handling forms`](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/02-inputs/04-forms)\n"

    " - [`Routing`](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/04-applications/01-routing)\n"
    " - [`Creating components`](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/05-components/01-basic-setup)\n"
    " - [`Creating server components`](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/06-server-components/01-basic-setup)\n"
    "\n"
    " ## Companion libraries\n"
    "\n"
    " While this package contains the runtime and API necessary for building and\n"
    " rendering applications, there is also a small collection of companion libraries\n"
    " built to make building Lustre applications easier:\n"
    "\n"
    " - [lustre/ui](https://github.com/lustre-labs/ui) is a collection of pre-designed\n"
    "   elements and design tokens for building user interfaces with Lustre.\n"
    "\n"
    " - [lustre/ssg](https://github.com/lustre-labs/ssg) is a simple static site\n"
    "   generator that you can use to produce static HTML documents from your Lustre\n"
    "   applications.\n"
    "\n"
    " Both of these packages are heavy works in progress: any feedback or contributions\n"
    " are very welcome!\n"
    "\n"
    " ## Getting help\n"
    "\n"
    " If you're having trouble with Lustre or not sure what the right way to do\n"
    " something is, the best place to get help is the [Gleam Discord server](https://discord.gg/Fm8Pwmy).\n"
    " You could also open an issue on the [Lustre GitHub repository](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/issues).\n"
    "\n"
    " ## Contributing\n"
    "\n"
    " The best way to contribute to Lustre is by building things! If you've built\n"
    " something cool with Lustre you want to share then please share it on the\n"
    " `#sharing` channel in the  [Gleam Discord server](https://discord.gg/Fm8Pwmy).\n"
    " You can also tag Hayleigh on BlueSky [@hayleigh.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/hayleigh.dev).\n"
    "\n"
    " If you run into any issues or have ideas for how to improve Lustre, please\n"
    " open an issue on the [Lustre GitHub repository](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/issues).\n"
    " Fixes and improvements to the documentation are also very welcome!\n"
    "\n"
    " Finally, if you'd like, you can support the project through\n"
    " [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hayleigh-dot-dev). Sponsorship\n"
    " helps fund the copious amounts of coffee that goes into building and maintaining\n"
    " Lustre, and is very much appreciated!\n"
