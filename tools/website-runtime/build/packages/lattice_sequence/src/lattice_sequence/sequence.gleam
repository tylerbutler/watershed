//// A generic sequence CRDT using stable item IDs and YATA-style origins.
////
//// Each live item is stored with a stable internal ID plus left and right
//// origins for deterministic ordering. Deletes are represented as tombstones
//// that record the delete's op ID; `values` returns only non-deleted items.
////
//// The public editing API exposes index-based insert, delete, and move
//// operations while resolving stable item IDs internally, so callers do not
//// need to construct or manage item identifiers. Moves preserve item identity
//// and converge with single-winner semantics for concurrent moves of the same
//// item.
////
//// ## Replica identity
////
//// A sequence carries the replica ID it mints item IDs under. Both `merge`
//// and its alias `merge_as` require that identity explicitly:
//// `merge(state, incoming, local_replica)`. Operand order does not select
//// the output identity. Deltas and decoded snapshots retain their sender's
//// identity; merge them under your local identity before editing. Independent
//// writers must use distinct replica IDs.
////
//// ## Compaction
////
//// Long-lived sequences never shrink on their own: every delete leaves a
//// tombstone and every item carries origins. `compact` takes a stability
//// frontier — a `VersionVector` meaning "everything causally at or below
//// this is stable; no in-flight or future op references it" — and rewrites
//// the stable region: stable tombstones are dropped, runs of adjacent stable
//// items from the same replica with sequential counters are merged into
//// compact blocks, and origins of stable items are discarded. Items above
//// the frontier keep their full YATA representation.
////
//// Every dropped ID gets a forwarding entry pointing at its retained
//// neighbors, so anchors and rebased operations that still hold the ID can
//// resolve to the gap it left behind. The forwarding map and the applied
//// frontier travel with the state. Deriving a correct frontier is the
//// host's job (e.g. from a global sequencer's acknowledgement floor); the
//// frontier must be a causal cut over the ops applied to the sequence.
////
//// ## Example
////
//// ```gleam
//// import lattice_core/replica_id
//// import lattice_sequence/sequence
////
//// let assert Ok(list) =
////   sequence.insert_many(sequence.new(replica_id.new("node-a")), 0, [
////     "hello", "world",
////   ])
//// let assert Ok(list) = sequence.move(list, 0, 1)
////
//// sequence.values(list)  // -> ["world", "hello"]
//// ```
