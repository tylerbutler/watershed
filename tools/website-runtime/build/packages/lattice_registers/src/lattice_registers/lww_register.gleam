//// A last-writer-wins register (LWW-Register) CRDT.
////
//// Stores a single value with an associated timestamp. When two replicas
//// conflict, the value with the strictly higher timestamp wins. On equal
//// timestamps, the replica with the lexicographically greater `replica_id`
//// wins, ensuring fully commutative merge.
////
//// ## Example
////
//// ```gleam
//// import lattice_core/replica_id
//// import lattice_registers/lww_register
////
//// let a = lww_register.new("hello", 1, replica_id.new("node-a"))
//// let b = lww_register.new("world", 2, replica_id.new("node-b"))
//// let merged = lww_register.merge(a, b)
//// lww_register.value(merged)  // -> "world"
//// ```

///
/// `timestamp` should be a positive integer representing the logical time of
/// the write. Use a monotonically increasing source (e.g., wall-clock
/// milliseconds or a Lamport clock) so that later writes have higher values.
/// `replica_id` identifies the writing node and is used as a deterministic

///
/// If `timestamp > register.timestamp`, replaces the stored value and
/// write metadata. Otherwise returns the register unchanged. Supplying the
/// writer explicitly prevents a local write after `merge` from inheriting the
/// winning remote writer's identity.
///
/// Note that the comparison is *strict*, so a wall clock is not a safe source
/// on its own: it stalls for a millisecond at a time, and a second write
/// inside the same tick is silently dropped even when it came from this same
/// replica. Callers that write faster than their clock ticks should stamp
/// `int.max(wall_clock, timestamp(register) + 1)`, which keeps every local
/// write ordered while leaving `merge` commutative.

/// values. After a restart, use a fresh replica ID or restore a durable logical
/// clock that advances beyond every prior write from that ID.
