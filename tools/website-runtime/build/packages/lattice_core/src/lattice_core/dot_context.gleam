//// A dot context tracks observed events (dots) across replicas.
////
//// A "dot" is a pair of (replica_id, counter) uniquely identifying a single
//// write event. The dot context is used by causal CRDTs like MV-Register and
//// OR-Set to determine which operations have been observed and which can be
//// safely discarded during merge.
////
//// ## Example
////
//// ```gleam
//// import lattice_core/dot_context.{Dot}
//// import lattice_core/replica_id
////
//// let node_a = replica_id.new("node-a")
//// let node_b = replica_id.new("node-b")
//// let ctx = dot_context.new()
////   |> dot_context.add_dot(node_a, 1)
////   |> dot_context.add_dot(node_b, 1)
//// dot_context.contains_dots(ctx, [Dot(node_a, 1)])  // -> True
//// ```
