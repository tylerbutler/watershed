# lattice_text

Plain-text CRDT for Gleam using YATA-style left/right origins.

Use this package when replicas need to edit shared text concurrently and converge without coordination. All operations are grapheme-based, so emoji and combining sequences count as one unit. For a generic list CRDT, use `lattice_sequence` directly.

## Installation

```sh
gleam add lattice_text
```

## Quick example

```gleam
import lattice_core/replica_id
import lattice_text/text

pub fn main() {
  let local = replica_id.new("node-a")
  let assert Ok(node_a) =
    text.new(local)
    |> text.insert(0, "Hello world")

  let assert Ok(node_b) =
    text.new(replica_id.new("node-b"))
    |> text.append("!")

  let merged = text.merge(node_a, node_b, local)

  text.value(merged)
  // -> "Hello world!"
}
```

## Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `lattice_text/text` | Grapheme-based text CRDT with editing, range, and delta operations. |

## Notes

- Editing operations: `insert`, `delete`, `delete_range`, `replace_range`, `move`, and `append`.
- Query helpers: `value`, `values`, `length`, `substring`, and `try_substring`.
- Edits (including `append`), `anchor_at`, and `resolve_anchor` return `Result`. Range operations return `RangeError` when `0 <= start <= end <= length` does not hold. Handle errors for untrusted inputs; the example asserts only known-valid operations.
- `substring` still clamps bounds; `try_substring` retains its strict `Result` contract.
- Delta-state variants (`*_with_delta`) return `Ok(#(updated, delta))`; apply a delta with `merge(state, delta, local_replica)`.
- `merge(a, b, replica)` requires the identity for subsequent local edits. `merge_as` is a forwarding alias. Either operand order produces the same full state for a fixed output identity. Independent writers must use distinct replica IDs.
- Decoded remote snapshots retain their serialized identity. Use `bind(state, local_id)` to adopt a snapshot without rebuilding it, or `merge` to combine it with local history.
- Cursor anchors: `anchor_at` creates a stable position that survives concurrent edits and merges, `resolve_anchor` maps it back to a current grapheme index, and `anchor_to_json`/`anchor_from_json` let anchors travel between replicas (e.g. shared cursors).
- `merge`, `to_json`, and `from_json` round-trip the full CRDT state using the canonical sequence JSON envelope.
- Backed by `lattice_sequence` stable item IDs, so concurrent edits converge deterministically on both Erlang and JavaScript targets.

## Map composition

`lattice_maps/crdt.TextSpec` creates an empty Text child. Use ORMap when
concurrent child edits must merge; use its sparse callback with the delta
from a Text `*_with_delta` operation to avoid sending the full document.
This remains sparse through nested ORMap paths.

Map re-addition creates a fresh generation with a new editing namespace.
Newer generations replace older content. A LWWMap Text assignment instead
replaces a whole snapshot and does not merge losing concurrent edits.

Text dispatch uses a distinct wrapper around this package's unchanged
Sequence JSON envelope. Do not infer Text from a bare Sequence envelope.
Outer map clocks do not authorize inner sequence compaction.
